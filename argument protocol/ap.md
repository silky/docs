Below I describe the Argument Protocol. It is a strategy that can be used whenever
you would like to have a clear and useful argument on a topic of some importance with
some friends of colleagues. To be used properly, all parties will need to be aware of
the protocol.

The Protocol
--

There are 5 steps. In summary, they are:

  1. Consideration of argument importance,

  1. Statement of conflicting positions,

  1. Statement of conditions for loss,

  1. Argument,

  1. Review.


Consideration of argument importance
--

*Goal*: Establish potential rationality of argument.

The first step, before proposing to use the protocol, is for everyone involved to
evaluate how important the particular argument would be, to each other. Essentially
the idea is to decide whether or not it is worth investing time in the remainder of
the protocol, and in particular it is appropriate to decide if the outcome of this
application of the protocol is likely to be useful and good.


Statement of conflicting positions
--

*Goals*: Determine objective argument positions, disassociation of argument from person.

This step is perhaps obvious, but is often not done explicitly. Here we would like
a clear and *objective* definition of the respective positions of both parties. In
particular, all subjective claims should be resolved.

In the resolution of subjective terms, it should also be that the argument becomes as
de-personalised as possible. The hope is that by the end of this, two completely
objective positions are found, and that neither party feels emotionally attached to
them.


State conditions for loss
--

*Goal*: Ensure useful argument outcome, promote direct consideration of each others
views.

Each party should state the criteria under which they will accept defeat. If a given
party can't come up with a condition then they do not get to participate. It may be
that the condition is essentially the negation of their conflicting position; but
explicit consideration of this step may also allow either party to realise that their
position is perhaps still subjective or irrational. At the very least, it forces each
party to consider the contradictory view to their own, and perhaps gain some insight
into the others position.


Argument
--

*Goal*: Logically explore the topic and resolve conflicting positions.

Finally the typical argument should take place, and of course typical approaches
should be followed.


Review
--

*Goal*: Ensure the process was useful.

Upon successful arguing on either party, the loss conditions will be reviewed, and
the learnings on some party can be noted. At this stage, it is guaranteed that one
person has changed their mind, and I think that is what is really important in any
argument; otherwise it is useless. It is appropriate to recall that just because
a mind has been changed, doesn't mean either party should feel bad. Indeed, both
parties should feel *good* that the matter has been truly resolved.
